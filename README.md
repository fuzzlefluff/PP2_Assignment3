# PP2_Assignment3
An Assignment were we used arrays to store employee data of the different employee subclass types. We then used the array to print out employee pay data. We also were to hand draw a UML Diagram but I was smarter and lazier than that and used an eclipse plugin to generate one for me :D.


Made in Eclipse/Java, src will be the raw code, bin is compiled.
